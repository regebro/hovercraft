:title: Hovercraft! demo
:data-transition-duration: 1500

This is a demo for Hovercraft! You can view it as a finished presentation
at http://regebro.github.com/hovercraft/


It's also useful as an example, in which case it's supposed to be read as
`source code <../_sources/examples/hovercraft.txt>`_.

You can render this presentation to HTML with the command::

    hovercraft hovercraft.rst outdir
    
And then view the outdir/index.html file to see how it turned out.

If you are seeing this text, and not reading this as source code, you are
doing it wrong! It's going to be confusing and not very useful.

Use The Source, Luke! But first you probably want to read through the
official documentation at https://hovercraft.readthedocs.org/

The problem:
============

Making presentations is no *fun!*
---------------------------------

.. note::

    Welcome to the presenter console!

----

GUI tools are inflexible
========================

* It's hard to reorganize or import text

* Sluggy and memory hungry

* You get caught up in design early in the process.

.. note::

    Here you have a view of the current slide, a preview of the next slide
    and your notes.

----

Use reStructuredText!
=====================

* You can use your favorite text-editor!

* Many tools available: Landslide, S5

* Convenient (and powerful!)

.. note::

    You also have a clock and a timer, so you know how much time you have
    left.

----

But then there was Prezi
========================

Sliding from left to right is no longer enough.

You need to be able to...

.. note::

    If you click on the timer it restarts from zero. This is handy when you
    are rehearsing the presentation and need to make sure it fits in the time
    allocated.

----

:data-y: r1000

...pan...
=========

.. note::

    If you have more notes than fits in the console, you can scroll down, but
    more handily, you can scroll the text up by pressing space bar.

----

:data-rotate: 90

...rotate...
============

.. note::

   If there isn't more text to scroll up, space bar will go to the next
   slide. Therefore you, as a presenter, just press space everytime you run
   out of things to say!

----

:data-x: r0
:data-y: r500
:data-scale: 0.1

...and zoom!
============

.. note::

    Zooming is cool. But one day it will grow old as well. What will we do
    then to make presentations interesting?

----

:data-x: r-800
:data-scale: 1

But Prezi is a GUI
==================

So we are back to square one.

(And it is closed source to boot)

.. note::

    It's probably back to making bad jokes again.
    
----

What about impress.js?
======================

It's open source!

Supports pan, tilt and zoom!


----

:id: ThreeD
:data-y: r1200
:data-rotate-x: 180

In three dimensions!
====================

*But...*

.. note::

    Wow! 3D! You didn't see that one coming, did you?
    
----


It's HTML...
============

Not a friendly format to edit

----

:data-x: r800

...and manual positioning
=========================

So inserting one slide means 

repositioning all the following slides!


.. note:: 

    The endless repositioning of slides is what prompted me to write
    Hovercraft! in the first place.

----

:id: thequestion
:data-x: r0
:data-y: r-1200

*Is there no solution?*
=======================

Of course there is!

.. note::

    What would be the point of this slide show if I didn't have a solution?
    Duh!

Position slides
===============

* Automatically!
* Absolutely!
* Relative to the previous slide!
* Along an SVG path!


.. note::

    That SVG path support was a lot of work. And all I used it for was to
    position the slides in circles.
    
----

Presenter console!
==================

* A view of the current slide
* A view of the next slide
* Your notes
* A clock
* A timer

.. note::

    You found the presenter console already!
