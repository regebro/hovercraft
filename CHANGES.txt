Changes
=======

2.0b2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


2.0b1 (2014-11-27)
------------------

- IMPORTANT! The positioning has been reimplemented. The most important change
  is that there is no longer any calculation of relative movement when you use
  absolute coordinates. Therefore, if you use absolute coordinates on some slides
  and then have no coordinates on other slides, your positioning may no longer
  be correct with version 2.0.

- Relative coordinates (starting with r) are now supported for all positioning,
  attributes including rotation and scaling.

- Images can now also have a :class: attribute.

- Having the "Requires Python 3" error when setup.py runs messes with some
  tools, so I moved it to a custom install class instead.

- Now includes a server-mode, that will serve the presentation via http and
  also re-generate the presentation if the source-files change.

- Added support for multiple levels of slides. This is to make it able
  to support for example Reveal.js through external templates.

- Moved the "note" XML transformation into the templates, as this is an
  impress.js feature, and other libraries, such as Reveal.js, will render
  it differently.

1.0b2 (2013-02-13)
