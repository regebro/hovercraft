This is an advanced presentation. It doesn't have a section in the first
step, meaning the first step will not be a step at all, but a sort of
introductory comment about the presentation, that will not show up in the
presentation at all.

It also sets a title and a transition-duration.

Advanced presentation
=====================

Here we show the positioning feature, where we can explicitly set a position
on one of the steps.

Formatting
==========

Let us also try some basic formatting, like *italic*, and **bold**.

* We can also
* have a list
* of things.

::

    There should also be possible to have 
    preformatted text for code.
    
    This slide has only code, and the next step
    has only an image. This is necessary for 
    many types of presentations.
